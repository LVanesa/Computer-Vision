## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🎮 [Mathable Score Calculator](https://github.com/LVanesa/Computer-Vision/tree/main/Mathable%20Game)
**Mathable Score Calculator** is a computer vision project that automates the detection of game pieces and number recognition in the Mathable game.

## Features 🔧
- **Image Preprocessing**: The application uses techniques such as blurring, sharpening, and color masking to extract the game grid. 🔍
- **Piece Placement Detection**: Detects the placement of new pieces on the game board. 📍
- **Digit Recognition**: Utilizes template matching for accurate number recognition on game pieces. 🔢
- **Score Calculation**: Calculates scores based on predefined game rules and updates the game state. 🏆
- **Tracking and Output**: Tracks player moves, updates the game board, and outputs final scores at the end. 📊

### 🔬 [Dexter's Laboratory Facial Detection](https://github.com/LVanesa/Computer-Vision/tree/main/Dexter's%20Laboratory%20Facial%20Detector)
**Dexter's Laboratory** is a computer vision project focused on facial detection of characters from the animated series.

## Features 🔍
- **Facial Detection and Recognition**: The system uses **Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for feature extraction and **Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for facial classification. 🧑‍🦱
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilized the **Albumentations** library for image transformations like flipping, scaling, rotation, and perspective shifts to increase dataset variability. 🔄
- **Preprocessing**: Includes steps like histogram equalization, Gaussian blur, and HOG descriptor generation to improve face detection. 🎨
- **Training**: The model is trained on positive and negative examples of character faces. 📚
- **Evaluation**: Performance is assessed using precision-recall curves and metrics like **Average Precision (AP)**. 📊
